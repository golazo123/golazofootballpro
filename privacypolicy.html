    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID.</strong> We use the Google Advertising ID (Advertising ID) to deliver and personalize advertising. The Advertising ID is a resettable, non-personally-identifying identifier provided by the Android platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-personal technical data.</strong> Third-party services (for example, ad and analytics SDKs) may automatically collect non-personal information such as device type, OS version, app usage metrics, crash logs, and IP address. These data are used to improve the App and for advertising/analytics purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To serve and personalize advertisements so the App can remain free.</li>
      <li>To monitor app performance, analyze usage trends, and fix crashes or bugs.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations if required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:


<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">AdMob</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Analytics for Firebase</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">Firebase Crashlytics</a>.</p></li>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Sale</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent personal information. We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the App (e.g., ad networks and analytics providers). These service providers are contractually required to protect the data and use it only for the purposes we specify.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID reset &amp; opt-out:</strong> Android users can reset or opt out of personalized advertising by visiting the device <em>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads</em> and choosing <code>Reset advertising ID</code> or <code>Opt out of Ads Personalization</code>. You can also visit Google’s Ads Settings at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">adssettings.google.com</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad personalization:</strong> If you opt out of personalized ads, ad providers may still display ads, but they will not be tailored using the Advertising ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we have collected personal information from a child, please contact us and we will take steps to delete the information.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information within our control. However, no electronic transmission or storage system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Information processed by third-party service providers may be transferred to and stored in countries outside your own. These providers will process data in accordance with their privacy practices.</p>
